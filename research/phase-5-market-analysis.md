# Phase 5: Eastern Nebraska Market Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Eastern Nebraska trophy/awards market is a **small but underserved market** centered on the Omaha metro area (~1M population). DataForSEO business listings reveal 8-10 active trophy shops within 80km of Omaha, with most concentrated in the Omaha/Bellevue corridor. Fremont (30 miles NW) has **zero dedicated trophy competitors**, giving The Trophy Case geographic exclusivity for its immediate market. Search volumes are modest but highly actionable, with seasonal peaks in spring (youth sports) and late summer (back-to-school/corporate).

## A. Local Search Volume Data (DataForSEO Google Ads)

### Verified Keyword Volumes (Nebraska/Omaha Targeting)

| Keyword | Monthly Volume | CPC | Competition | Seasonal Peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| trophy shop omaha | 90 | $3.85 | HIGH | Apr, Jul, Aug |
| trophy store omaha | 90 | $3.85 | HIGH | Apr, Jul, Aug |
| plaques omaha | 10 | - | - | Consistent |
| trophy shop lincoln ne | 20 | $2.51 | HIGH | May, Jul |

### Keywords with No Measurable Volume (<10/mo)

The following keywords returned no data in DataForSEO, confirming they have <10 monthly searches individually:
- custom trophies omaha
- engraving services omaha
- trophy shop fremont ne
- engraving fremont ne
- custom awards omaha
- awards and trophies omaha

**Key Insight:** Individual long-tail local keywords are very low volume, but collectively they represent meaningful traffic. The primary local strategy should target the ~200/mo cluster of "trophy shop" + "near me" + city-specific terms identified in Phase 2.

### Seasonality Pattern

Trophy/award searches in Nebraska follow a clear seasonal cycle:
- **Peak 1 (April-May):** Spring sports awards season, corporate Q1 recognition
- **Peak 2 (July-August):** Summer sports camps/leagues, back-to-school prep
- **Trough (November-January):** Holiday season depresses trophy-specific searches
- **Implication:** Website launch timing should target February-March to capture the spring peak

- **JoDon Designs** - Bellevue, 4.7 stars with 18 reviews. Smaller operation.

## D. Market Sizing

### Fremont Immediate Market (0-15 mile radius)

| Metric | Estimate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Population served | ~35,000 | Fremont + surrounding Dodge County |
| Trophy-buying organizations | ~200-300 | Schools, churches, sports leagues, businesses |
| Estimated annual trophy/award spend | $150,000-$250,000 | $500-1,000/org avg, subset that buys |
| The Trophy Case capturable share | 40-60% | Only local shop; some leakage to Omaha |
| **Fremont market opportunity** | **$60,000-$150,000/yr** | Walk-in + local delivery |

### Omaha Metro Market (15-40 mile radius)

| Metric | Estimate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Population served | ~950,000 | Omaha-Council Bluffs MSA |
| Trophy-buying organizations | ~3,000-5,000 | Much larger base |
| Estimated annual trophy/award spend | $2M-$4M | Regional market |
| The Trophy Case capturable share | 3-8% | Competing against 6-8 established shops |
| **Omaha market opportunity** | **$60,000-$320,000/yr** | Requires strong SEO + GBP |

### Combined Local Market Opportunity

| Scenario | Annual Revenue Potential | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Conservative** (Fremont only) | $60,000-$100,000 | Basic website + GBP optimization |
| **Moderate** (Fremont + some Omaha) | $120,000-$250,000 | Strong local SEO + reviews strategy |
| **Aggressive** (Full metro capture) | $200,000-$400,000 | Dominant local SEO + content marketing |

## E. Key Findings for Proposal

1. **Fremont has zero trophy shop competition.** The Trophy Case owns its immediate geographic market by default. The website just needs to be findable.

2. **The Omaha metro has 6-8 active competitors** but none dominate digitally. Center Trophy leads with only 93 keywords and 454/mo traffic - this is a low bar.

3. **Seasonal peaks in April-May and July-August** suggest a February-March website launch would maximize first-year impact.

4. **Review acquisition is the #1 local priority.** Every competitor has 15-55 reviews. The Trophy Case's 6 reviews at 4.3 stars is the biggest single barrier to local pack visibility.

5. **The local market alone supports $60K-$250K in annual revenue** depending on how aggressively The Trophy Case pursues Omaha metro customers beyond Fremont.

6. **Lincoln (55 miles) is a separate market** with its own competitor (Rixstine Recognition). Not worth targeting in initial strategy.
