# Phase 6: Traffic Projections Model

## Methodology & Assumptions

### Projection Basis
- **Keyword data** from Phase 2 (search volumes, KD scores)
- **Competitive benchmarks** from Phases 3-5 (competitor traffic levels, ranking distributions)
- **Industry CTR curves** for organic search positions (Position 1: ~28%, Position 3: ~11%, Position 5: ~6%, Position 10: ~2.5%)
- **Conservative approach**: All projections use the lower bound of ranges. Real results may exceed these estimates.

### Key Assumptions
1. Website launches Month 0 with proper technical SEO, schema markup, and optimized content
2. Google Business Profile optimized in Month 1; review generation begins immediately
3. Content publishing cadence: 2-4 pages/month for Option 1, 8-15 pages/month for Option 2
4. No paid advertising (confirmed cost-prohibitive in Phase 2)
5. Keyword difficulty scores of 3-15 allow ranking improvements within 2-6 months
6. Domain age penalty: New domain takes ~3 months to begin ranking for any terms

## E. Key Findings for Proposal

1. **Option 1 reaches meaningful traffic (150-250/mo) by Month 12.** This is realistic for a local service business and sufficient to generate 8-25 quality leads per month.

2. **Option 2 reaches 300-650/mo by Month 12 and 870-1,840/mo by Month 24.** The e-commerce component takes longer to build but adds substantial volume in Year 2.

3. **GBP (Google Business Profile) traffic is nearly half of all local traffic.** GBP optimization should begin immediately and doesn't depend on the website being finished.

4. **Month 3-6 is the "patience zone."** New domains take time to gain traction. Setting proper expectations with the client is critical.

5. **Conservative projections intentionally understate likely results.** These projections use lower bounds throughout. A well-executed strategy could exceed the upper bounds by Month 18-24.
