### Local Competitor Comparison Matrix

| Metric | Center Trophy | 4 Seasons | Midwest Trophy | Omaha Engraving | **The Trophy Case** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Organic Traffic (ETV) | 454/mo | 58/mo | 150/mo | 281/mo | **0.8/mo** |
| Organic Keywords | 93 | 17 | 56 | 117 | **5** |
| Keywords in Top 10 | 7 | 8 | 7 | 13 | **0** |
| Google Rating | 4.9 | 4.8 | 4.8 | - | **4.3** |
| Google Reviews | 47 | 34 | 29 | - | **6** |
| Traffic Value ($/mo) | $1,562 | $86 | $570 | $715 | **$3** |

### Key Local Insights

1. **Center Trophy is the clear local leader** with 4.9 stars, 47 reviews, and consistent Local Pack #1 rankings. They are the primary local competitor to benchmark against.

2. **The review gap is significant.** The Trophy Case has 6 reviews at 4.3 stars vs. competitors averaging 35+ reviews at 4.8+ stars. Google heavily weights review count and rating for local pack rankings.

3. **Even modest local competitors outperform The Trophy Case by 50-500x** in organic traffic. Omaha Engraving (281/mo) and Midwest Trophy (150/mo) - neither of which are market leaders - still vastly outperform The Trophy Case's 0.8/mo.

4. **The Trophy Case does NOT appear in ANY local SERPs.** Not in the local pack, not in organic results, not even on page 2-3 for any target query. They are completely invisible.

5. **National brands are encroaching on local results.** EDCO and Awarding You rank in Omaha organic results with localized landing pages, demonstrating that national SEO strategy can capture local traffic.

6. **Fremont's 30-mile distance from Omaha is both a challenge and opportunity.** No competitor is based in Fremont itself, so "trophy shop fremont ne" and similar terms have virtually zero competition.

## B. National E-Commerce Competitors - Medals (Option 2)

### SERP Results for "custom medals" (United States)

| Rank | Domain | Brand | Price Range | Key Differentiator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1 | gs-jj.com | GS-JJ.com | ~$1.84/medal | Lowest price, bulk manufacturer |
| #2 | k2awards.com | K2 Awards | $3-$7 | Broad catalog, strong SEO |
| #3 | hodgesbadge.com | Hodges Badge Company | - | Badge/medal specialist |
| #4 | crownawards.com | Crown Awards | $0.99-$2.99 | Massive catalog, brand recognition |
| #5 | custommedals.com | Custom Medals | $6.00 | Exact-match domain, 25+ years |
| #6 | trophydepot.com | Trophy Depot | $10-$12 | Higher price point, broader catalog |
| #7 | justawardmedals.com | Just Award Medals | - | Medal-specific specialist |
| #8 | maxmedals.com | Maxwell Medals | - | Medal specialist |
| #9 | gemawards.com | Gem Awards | $9-$12, no minimums | No minimum orders |

**Google also showed a Popular Products carousel** featuring Crown Awards, GS-JJ, Etsy, and K2 Awards - indicating Google Shopping integration is important for this category.

### National Medal Competitor Domain Metrics

| Competitor | Organic Traffic (ETV) | Organic Keywords | Keywords Top 10 | Traffic Value ($/mo) | Scale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **GS-JJ.com** | 210,433/mo | 16,652 | 2,129 | $1,328,847 | Massive |
| **Crown Awards** | 252,775/mo | 17,299 | 5,289 | $900,468 | Massive |
| **K2 Awards** | 88,644/mo | 5,393 | 1,719 | $394,139 | Large |
| **Trophy Depot** | 19,578/mo | 4,968 | 1,290 | $83,093 | Medium |
| **Awards.com** | 54,743/mo | 3,854 | 1,571 | $420,345 | Large |
| **PlaqueMaker** | 51,368/mo | 5,439 | 1,374 | $179,730 | Large |
| **Custom Medals** | 969/mo | 667 | 34 | $2,505 | Small |

### Medal Market Competitive Assessment

- **Top tier (Crown Awards, GS-JJ):** 200,000+ monthly organic visits, 16,000+ keywords. These are industry giants with decades of SEO investment. Direct competition on head terms is unrealistic.
- **Mid tier (K2, Awards.com, PlaqueMaker):** 50,000-90,000 monthly visits, 3,800-5,400 keywords. Strong but not insurmountable on long-tail terms.
- **Lower tier (Trophy Depot, Custom Medals):** 1,000-20,000 monthly visits. Trophy Depot shows that a 5,000-keyword strategy with mostly position 4-10 rankings can still drive ~20,000 visits/month.
- **Opportunity signal:** custommedals.com ranks #5 with only 667 keywords and 969/mo traffic, relying heavily on its exact-match domain. This suggests the middle of the SERP has gaps that a well-optimized site could exploit.

## C. National E-Commerce Competitors - Plaques (Option 2)

### SERP Results for "custom plaques" (United States)

| Rank | Domain | Brand | Price Range | Key Differentiator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1 | k2awards.com | K2 Awards | $15-$192 | Broad catalog leader |
| #2 | plaquemaker.com | PlaqueMaker | $100+, free delivery | Exact-match domain, premium positioning |

| #4 | amazon.com | Amazon | Varies | Marketplace dominance |
| #5 | smartsign.com | SmartSign | $28-$76 | Sign/plaque crossover |
| #6 | awards.com | Awards.com | $28-$160 | Exact-match domain |
| #7 | fineawards.com | FineAwards | $21-$188 | Premium focus |
| #8 | creativelasering.com | Creative Laser Solutions | $37-$69 | Laser-specific |
| #9 | fastsigns.com | FASTSIGNS | - | Franchise/sign company |
| #10 | trophydepot.com | Trophy Depot | $25-$889 | Broadest price range |

**Google also showed a Popular Products carousel** for plaques, confirming product listing ads and Google Shopping are active in this space.

### Plaque Market Competitive Assessment

- **Amazon at #4 is notable** - it's the only query where Amazon ranks. This means the plaque market has more mainstream e-commerce competition than medals.
- **PlaqueMaker (exact-match domain) at #2** has 51,368/mo organic traffic with 5,439 keywords - demonstrating the power of domain name + SEO for this niche.
- **Price ranges vary enormously** ($5-$889), suggesting room for differentiation at specific price points.
- **Creative Laser Solutions at #8** is interesting - a smaller, laser-focused (literally) business ranking among giants, showing niche specialization can compete.

## D. Competitive Gap Analysis

### The Trophy Case vs. Local Market

| Metric | Market Average (Local Top 4) | The Trophy Case | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Organic Keywords | 71 | 5 | **-93%** |
| Organic Traffic (ETV) | 236/mo | 0.8/mo | **-99.7%** |
| Google Reviews | 35 | 6 | **-83%** |
| Google Rating | 4.8 | 4.3 | **-0.5 stars** |
| Keywords in Top 10 | 9 | 0 | **-100%** |
| Website Quality | Basic but functional | Broken template | **Critical gap** |

### The Trophy Case vs. National E-Commerce Entry Point

To compete nationally for medals/plaques, The Trophy Case would need to reach the performance level of the *weakest* SERP competitors:

| Metric | Minimum to Compete (Custom Medals #9 level) | Trophy Depot Level (mid-tier) | Current Trophy Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Organic Keywords | ~500 | 4,968 | 5 |
| Organic Traffic | ~500/mo | 19,578/mo | 0.8/mo |
| Content Pages | ~50 | ~500+ | 6 |
| Product Pages | ~100 | ~1,000+ | 0 |

## E. Competitive Advantages & Opportunities

### What The Trophy Case Can Leverage

1. **Fremont location exclusivity.** No competitor is based in Fremont. "Trophy shop fremont ne," "engraving fremont ne," and similar terms have essentially zero competition. This is a geographic moat.

2. **Low local keyword difficulty.** KD scores of 3-15 mean ranking improvements are achievable in 2-6 months even against established competitors.

3. **Review gap is closable.** Moving from 6 to 30+ reviews at 4.8+ stars is achievable within 6-12 months with a review generation strategy. This alone could unlock Local Pack rankings.

4. **Local competitors have weak websites.** Center Trophy (centertrophy.com) has only 93 keywords - this is not an SEO powerhouse. A properly optimized new site could surpass local competitors relatively quickly.

5. **National long-tail opportunity.** The gap between Trophy Depot (#6 for medals, 19,578/mo traffic) and Custom Medals (#5, 969/mo traffic) shows huge variance in the mid-SERP, suggesting well-targeted long-tail content can find footholds.

6. **No-minimum-order differentiation.** Gem Awards (#9 for medals) specifically advertises "no minimums" - if The Trophy Case can offer single-medal/plaque orders with customization (via Zakeke), this is a viable differentiator against bulk-focused competitors.

### Barriers to Entry

1. **National e-commerce requires massive content investment.** Competitors ranking for 5,000-17,000 keywords have hundreds of product pages and years of content.

2. **Google Shopping/Product Listings** are active in both medal and plaque SERPs, meaning product data feeds and structured data are table stakes.

3. **Domain authority gap is enormous** for national competition. The Trophy Case has virtually no backlink profile vs. competitors with thousands of referring domains.

4. **Price competition is fierce** on medals ($0.99-$12 range). Margins may be thin for e-commerce medals.

## F. Strategic Competitor Targets

### For Option 1 (Local Lead-Gen): Beat These Competitors

| Priority | Competitor | Why | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **4 Seasons Awards** | Weakest SEO (17 keywords, 58/mo traffic) but strong local pack | Medium - need GBP optimization |
| 2 | **Midwest Trophy** | Council Bluffs location disadvantage; 56 keywords | Medium |
| 3 | **Omaha Engraving** | 117 keywords but no local pack presence noted | Medium |
| 4 | **Center Trophy** | Market leader, 454/mo traffic, 4.9 stars | Hard - long-term target |

### For Option 2 (National E-Commerce): Compete With These

| Priority | Competitor | Why | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Custom Medals** | Only 667 keywords, 969/mo traffic - weakest medal ranker | Achievable (12-18 months) |
| 2 | **Gem Awards** | "No minimums" positioning, $9-12 range | Achievable (12-18 months) |
| 3 | **Creative Lasering** | Small laser business ranking #8 for plaques | Achievable (9-15 months) |
| 4 | **Trophy Depot** | 4,968 keywords, 19,578/mo - realistic 18-24 month target | Aspirational |

## G. Key Findings for Proposal

1. **The Trophy Case is invisible.** Zero appearances in any SERP for any target keyword. This is the worst possible starting position but also means any improvement is dramatic.

2. **Local competition is beatable.** The strongest local competitor (Center Trophy) has only 93 organic keywords and 454/mo traffic. These are not SEO-sophisticated businesses. A properly built and optimized site can realistically challenge for local rankings within 6-12 months.

3. **National e-commerce competition is steep but has gaps.** While top competitors have 200,000+ monthly visits, the lower end of page-1 rankings shows sites with 500-1,000 monthly visits. Long-tail keyword strategies targeting specific medal/plaque niches can find footholds.

4. **Google reviews are a critical local ranking factor.** The Trophy Case needs to go from 6 reviews to 30+ reviews to compete in the Local Pack. This should be a priority initiative regardless of which option is chosen.

5. **Fremont geographic exclusivity is a real advantage.** No competitor owns "Fremont NE" trophy/award/engraving searches. This is effectively uncontested territory for local SEO.

6. **The competitive landscape validates both options.** Option 1 faces beatable local competition with a clear path to results. Option 2 adds national opportunity where long-tail niches remain accessible despite strong top-of-market competitors.
