|---|---|---|---|
| Local "near me" trophy/awards | 200 | 25-35% | 50-70 |
| Local "near me" engraving | 80 | 15-25% | 12-20 |
| City-specific (Omaha/Fremont) | 100 | 30-40% | 30-40 |

## H. Ads Cost-Prohibitive Analysis (Confirms Option 2 E-Commerce via SEO)

### Why Paid Ads Don't Work for This Business

| Metric | Medals | Plaques | Acrylic/Glass Awards |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average CPC | $6.00 | $4.50 | $12.73 |
| Competition Level | HIGH | HIGH | HIGH |
| Clicks to Convert (2% CVR) | 50 per order | 50 per order | 50 per order |
| Cost Per Acquisition | $300 | $225 | $637 |
| Typical Order Value | $50-75 | $40-80 | $75-200 |
| **ROAS** | **0.17-0.25x** | **0.18-0.36x** | **0.12-0.31x** |

At these CPAs, paid advertising would result in a **net loss of $150-550 per order**. Even with a generous 5% conversion rate, medals ads would lose $25-75 per order.

**Conclusion:** Organic SEO is the **only cost-effective digital acquisition channel** for medals and plaques e-commerce. This validates the Option 2 approach of building organic rankings rather than running paid campaigns.

---

## I. Key Findings for Proposal

1. **Low keyword difficulty = fast ranking potential.** Most target keywords have KD scores of 3-15, meaning a properly optimized new site can begin ranking in 2-6 months.

2. **Strong transactional intent across all categories.** Searchers for custom medals, plaques, and trophies are actively looking to buy, supporting both lead-gen and e-commerce conversion.

3. **Local search volume is modest but highly valuable.** ~530 local searches/month may seem small, but at 5-10% conversion rates for local service businesses, this represents 25-50 quality leads per month.

4. **National e-commerce keywords add massive volume.** Medals + plaques alone represent ~26,000 monthly searches nationally. Even capturing 2-5% of this traffic represents significant e-commerce revenue.

5. **Ads are definitively cost-prohibitive.** With CPCs of $3-16 and typical order values of $40-200, paid advertising produces negative ROI across all product categories. SEO is the only viable channel.

6. **The keyword landscape strongly supports both options.** Option 1 has clear local opportunity; Option 2 adds substantial national opportunity with provably cost-prohibitive ad alternatives.
