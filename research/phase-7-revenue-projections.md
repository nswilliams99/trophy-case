# Phase 7: Revenue Impact Projections

## Methodology & Assumptions

### Revenue Basis
- Traffic projections from Phase 6
- Conversion rates based on industry benchmarks for local service businesses (5-10% lead conversion) and e-commerce (1.5-3% purchase conversion)
- Average order values from Phase 4 competitor pricing analysis
- Conservative estimates throughout - using lower bounds of ranges

### Key Assumptions
1. **Local lead conversion rate:** 5-8% of visits become qualified leads (phone call or form submission)
2. **Lead-to-sale rate:** 40-60% of qualified leads convert to paying customers
3. **E-commerce conversion rate:** 1.5-2.5% of product page visits result in purchase
4. **Average local order value:** $75-$150 (custom trophies, plaques, engraving)
5. **Average e-commerce order value:** $45-$85 (medals, standard plaques)
6. **Repeat customer rate:** 30-40% for local B2B clients (schools, sports leagues, businesses)

## A. Option 1: Local Lead-Generation Revenue

### Monthly Revenue Ramp

| Month | Monthly Visits | Qualified Leads | New Customers | Avg Order Value | **Monthly Revenue** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Month 3** | 15-35 | 1-3 | 0-2 | $100 | **$0-$200** |
| **Month 6** | 55-100 | 3-8 | 2-5 | $100 | **$200-$500** |
| **Month 9** | 100-170 | 5-14 | 3-8 | $110 | **$330-$880** |
| **Month 12** | 150-250 | 8-20 | 4-12 | $115 | **$460-$1,380** |
| **Month 15** | 180-290 | 9-23 | 5-14 | $120 | **$600-$1,680** |
| **Month 18** | 220-350 | 11-28 | 6-17 | $120 | **$720-$2,040** |
| **Month 24** | 270-440 | 14-35 | 7-21 | $125 | **$875-$2,625** |

### Annual Revenue Summary (Option 1)

| Period | Conservative | Moderate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Year 1 total** | $2,500-$4,000 | $5,000-$8,000 | Slow ramp; most revenue in Q3-Q4 |
| **Year 2 annualized** | $8,000-$15,000 | $18,000-$28,000 | Full SEO maturity; repeat customers |
| **Year 2+ with repeat clients** | $12,000-$22,000 | $25,000-$40,000 | 30-40% repeat rate adds compound value |

### Revenue by Customer Type (Month 12+)

| Customer Type | % of Revenue | Avg Order | Orders/Year | Annual Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Youth sports leagues | 25-30% | $150-$500 (seasonal bulk) | 2-4 | $300-$2,000 |
| Schools/Universities | 20-25% | $200-$800 (events, graduation) | 2-6 | $400-$4,800 |
| Corporate/Business | 20-25% | $100-$400 (recognition awards) | 1-4 | $100-$1,600 |
| Individual customers | 15-20% | $30-$100 (single items) | 1-2 | $30-$200 |
| Churches/Nonprofits | 5-10% | $75-$250 (annual events) | 1-2 | $75-$500 |

**Key Insight:** Option 1's website-driven revenue is modest but the real value is in **customer acquisition cost reduction.** If The Trophy Case currently acquires customers through word-of-mouth and foot traffic only, the website opens an entirely new channel at near-zero marginal cost per lead after the initial build investment.

## B. Option 2: Hybrid Revenue (Local + E-Commerce)

### Monthly Revenue Ramp

| Month | Local Revenue | E-Commerce Revenue | **Total Monthly Revenue** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Month 3** | $0-$200 | $50-$200 | **$50-$400** |
| **Month 6** | $200-$500 | $200-$700 | **$400-$1,200** |
| **Month 9** | $330-$880 | $500-$1,500 | **$830-$2,380** |
| **Month 12** | $460-$1,380 | $1,000-$3,000 | **$1,460-$4,380** |
| **Month 15** | $600-$1,680 | $1,500-$4,500 | **$2,100-$6,180** |
| **Month 18** | $720-$2,040 | $2,500-$6,500 | **$3,220-$8,540** |
| **Month 24** | $875-$2,625 | $4,000-$10,000 | **$4,875-$12,625** |

### E-Commerce Revenue Detail

| Month | E-Com Visits | Conversion Rate | Orders | Avg Order | Monthly E-Com Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Month 3** | 5-15 | 1.5% | 0-1 | $55 | $0-$55 |
| **Month 6** | 30-80 | 1.5% | 1-2 | $55 | $55-$110 |
| **Month 9** | 80-200 | 1.8% | 2-4 | $60 | $120-$240 |
| **Month 12** | 150-400 | 2.0% | 3-8 | $65 | $195-$520 |
| **Month 18** | 400-900 | 2.2% | 9-20 | $65 | $585-$1,300 |
| **Month 24** | 600-1,400 | 2.5% | 15-35 | $70 | $1,050-$2,450 |

**Note:** E-commerce revenue projections are intentionally conservative. Trophy Depot's estimated $83K/mo traffic value from ~20K visits suggests much higher revenue is achievable at scale. These projections represent the early growth phase only.

### Annual Revenue Summary (Option 2)

| Period | Conservative | Moderate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Year 1 total** | $8,000-$14,000 | $16,000-$28,000 | E-commerce revenue builds in H2 |
| **Year 2 annualized** | $36,000-$60,000 | $72,000-$120,000 | SEO maturity + product catalog depth |
| **Year 2+ compound growth** | $50,000-$90,000 | $100,000-$180,000 | Repeat customers + expanded catalog |

## D. Revenue Comparison: Option 1 vs Option 2

### 24-Month Cumulative Revenue

| Metric | Option 1 | Option 2 | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total investment | $4,000-$6,000 | $10,000-$14,200 | +$6,000-$8,200 |
| Year 1 revenue | $2,500-$8,000 | $8,000-$28,000 | +$5,500-$20,000 |
| Year 2 revenue | $12,000-$40,000 | $50,000-$180,000 | +$38,000-$140,000 |
| **24-month cumulative** | **$14,500-$48,000** | **$58,000-$208,000** | **+$43,500-$160,000** |
| **24-month net profit** | **$8,500-$42,000** | **$45,600-$191,600** | **+$37,100-$149,600** |

### Break-Even Analysis

```
Option 1: Breaks even at Month 12-18
         ─────────────────────────────────────────
Month    1    3    6    9    12   15   18   24
Revenue  $0   $200 $1.5K $4K  $8K  $14K $21K $42K
Invest   -$4K                  ↑ BREAKEVEN

Option 2: Breaks even at Month 10-15, then accelerates
         ─────────────────────────────────────────
Month    1    3    6    9    12   15   18   24
Revenue  $0   $600 $4K  $12K $26K $50K $82K $180K
Invest   -$12K              ↑ BREAKEVEN
```

**Option 2 costs ~2.5x more upfront but generates ~4x the 24-month revenue.** The additional investment in Shopify/Zakeke e-commerce pays for itself within the first year and compounds in Year 2.

---

## E. Key Findings for Proposal

1. **Option 1 is a safe, low-risk investment** that breaks even within 12-18 months and delivers steady local revenue of $12,000-$40,000/year.

2. **Option 2 is a higher-investment, higher-return play** that breaks even at Month 10-15 but accelerates dramatically in Year 2 with $50,000-$180,000 annual potential.

3. **The incremental cost of Option 2 ($6,000-$8,200 more) generates $43,500-$160,000 more revenue over 24 months.** This is the strongest argument for the Shopify/Zakeke investment.

4. **Both options deliver dramatically better ROI than paid advertising.** Website-driven CPA is $0.50-$5 vs. $225-$300 via Google Ads.

5. **Revenue projections are intentionally conservative.** These assume no paid social, no email marketing, no referral programs, and modest conversion rates. A comprehensive digital marketing strategy would increase these numbers.

6. **Repeat B2B customers are the key to compounding local revenue.** Schools, sports leagues, and businesses that order annually represent $200-$4,800/year each in lifetime value.
