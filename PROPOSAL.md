# The Trophy Case — Website & Digital Strategy Proposal

**Prepared for:** Gregg Schmidt, Owner
**Business:** The Trophy Case, 303 N Main St, Fremont, NE 68025
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The Trophy Case does $85,000 in annual revenue with $48,000 in profit — a solid business. But a significant portion of that revenue depends on your personal relationships: 10 wrestling meet weekends a year, car show trophy orders, and decades of word-of-mouth in Fremont. When you sell the business, those relationships don't automatically transfer to a buyer.

**A website with documented traffic and online sales does transfer.** It runs without you. A buyer sees a growth trajectory they can step into — not just a storefront that depends on the previous owner showing up at wrestling meets.

Your current Wix site generates less than 1 visit per month and ranks for zero keywords. Meanwhile, **Fremont has zero trophy shop competitors online** — you own your local market by default, the website just needs to be findable.

This proposal presents two options to build a digital presence that increases your business value before sale:

- **Option 1 ($5,500 + $157/mo):** Full website + online store for medals and plaques — maximizes transferable value
- **Option 2 ($2,750 + $99/mo):** Lead-generation website only — lower cost, local leads only

**Bottom line: A $2,750-$5,500 investment now could add $19,000-$34,000+ to your asking price within 2 years — even using the most conservative estimates.**

## The Problem

### Current Website Performance

| Metric | Current (Wix Site) | Local Leader (Center Trophy) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly organic traffic | **0.8 visits** | 454 visits |
| Organic keywords ranked | 5 | 93 |
| Keywords in top 10 | **0** | 7 |
| Google reviews | 6 (4.3 stars) | 47 (4.9 stars) |
| Products listed on site | **0** | Full catalog |

### What This Means for a Sale

A buyer evaluating your business sees:
1. **No online presence.** Zero digital revenue, zero organic traffic — the business is invisible online.
2. **Revenue tied to the owner.** Wrestling meets, car shows, and word-of-mouth all depend on you being there.
3. **No growth trajectory.** Without a website generating leads and sales, there's no documented upward trend to justify a higher price.

## Market Opportunity

### Local Market (Fremont + Omaha Metro)

- **Fremont/Dodge County (35,000 population):** Zero trophy shop competitors online. Estimated $60,000-$150,000/year capturable market.
- **Omaha Metro (950,000 population):** 6-8 competitors, none digitally dominant. Estimated $60,000-$320,000/year capturable share.

### Search Demand

| Keyword Category | Monthly Searches | Competition Level |
|---|---|---|
| "trophy shop" + city terms (Omaha/Fremont) | ~200/mo | Low (KD 3-5) |
| "near me" trophy/engraving searches | ~70/mo local | Low-Medium (KD 4-33) |
| "custom medals" (national) | 4,400/mo | Medium (KD 18) |
| "custom plaques" (national) | 6,600/mo | Medium (KD 23) |

### Seasonality

Trophy/award searches peak in **April-May** (spring sports, Q1 corporate recognition) and **July-August** (summer leagues, back-to-school). A February-March launch captures the first peak and gives you 12-18 months of documented traffic growth before listing the business for sale.

## Option 1: Online Store + Lead-Gen Website — $5,500

### What You Get

A professionally built, SEO-optimized website that generates local leads (phone calls, quote requests, walk-in traffic) **plus** a Shopify-powered online store for **medals and plaques** — standardized, shippable products that customers can customize and order online nationwide. Trophies, engraving, and other custom work remain in-store services driven by the lead-gen site.

**80-120 pages at launch:**
- Full lead-gen site (homepage, 7 service pages, 5 area-served pages, gallery, about, contact, FAQ, reviews, blog)
- Shopify store with 50-100 medal and plaque products
- Zakeke visual product customizer — customers preview their engraving, logos, and colors in real-time before ordering
- Guest checkout, shipping calculator, discount codes, inventory management

### Why This Is Best for a Business Sale

Your two most successful competitors both run on Shopify:
- **Trophy Depot:** 19,578 visits/mo, ~$83K traffic value — Shopify store
- **K2 Awards:** 88,644 visits/mo — Shopify store

An online store generates **documented, transferable revenue** that doesn't depend on you. A buyer can look at Shopify analytics and see exactly how much the store earns per month. That's worth real money in a sale negotiation.

Neither competitor offers real-time visual product customization. **Zakeke gives The Trophy Case a competitive edge** — customers see exactly what their engraved plaque or custom medal looks like before ordering.

### Technology

|---|---|---|---|
| Lead-gen site (Next.js + Vercel) | Static site, free hosting | $0 | $0 |

**22-28 pages at launch:**
- Homepage with trust signals, services overview, and calls to action
- 7 service pages (custom trophies, medals, plaques, engraving, acrylic awards, glass awards, corporate awards)
- 5 area-served pages (Fremont, Omaha, Wahoo, Blair, Dodge County)
- Gallery/portfolio, About, Contact, FAQ, Reviews page

| **Year 2** | **$12,000-$40,000** |

*Slow ramp in Year 1; most revenue in Q3-Q4. Year 2 reflects SEO maturity and repeat customers.*

### Investment & ROI

| Metric | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Build cost | $2,750 |
| Annual ongoing costs (domain + SEO) | $1,203 |
| Year 1 revenue | $2,500-$8,000 |

| Breakeven | Month 12-18 |
| 2-Year ROI | 181-831% |

### Upgrade Path

Option 2 is built on the same Next.js architecture as Option 1. If you or a future buyer decides to add a Shopify store later, it plugs in without rebuilding the site.

## How This Increases Your Sale Price

Small businesses typically sell for **1.5-3x annual profit.** Here's how a website changes the math over 1, 2, and 3 years — using conservative low-end estimates throughout.

### Without a Website (Today)

| Metric | Current |
|---|---|
| Annual revenue | $85,000 |
| Annual profit | $48,000 |
| Asking price (1-1.7x profit) | $45,000-$80,000 |
| **Key risk for buyer:** | Revenue depends on owner's relationships (wrestling meets, car shows, word-of-mouth) |

### With Option 1 — Website + Online Store ($5,500)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Website-added revenue | $3,100-$10,200 | $20,000-$62,000 | $30,000-$80,000 |
| Minus ongoing costs ($1,899/yr) | -$1,899 | -$1,899 | -$1,899 |
| **Net profit added by website** | **$1,201-$8,301** | **$18,101-$60,101** | **$28,101-$78,101** |
| Total business profit | $49,201-$56,301 | $66,101-$108,101 | $76,101-$126,101 |
| **Business sale value (1.5x profit)** | **$73,800-$84,500** | **$99,150-$162,150** | **$114,150-$189,150** |
| **Increase over today's asking ($45-$80K)** | **+$0-$39,500** | **+$19,150-$117,150** | **+$34,150-$144,150** |

*Year 3 revenue assumes continued SEO growth and repeat customer compounding. Conservative estimate: 50% increase over Year 2 low-end.*

### With Option 2 — Lead-Gen Website ($2,750)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Website-added revenue | $2,500-$8,000 | $12,000-$40,000 | $18,000-$55,000 |
| Minus ongoing costs ($1,203/yr) | -$1,203 | -$1,203 | -$1,203 |
| **Net profit added by website** | **$1,297-$6,797** | **$10,797-$38,797** | **$16,797-$53,797** |
| Total business profit | $49,297-$54,797 | $58,797-$86,797 | $64,797-$101,797 |
| **Business sale value (1.5x profit)** | **$74,000-$82,200** | **$88,200-$130,200** | **$97,200-$152,700** |
| **Increase over today's asking ($45-$80K)** | **+$0-$37,200** | **+$8,200-$85,200** | **+$17,200-$107,700** |

*Year 3 revenue assumes continued SEO growth and repeat B2B customers. Conservative estimate: 50% increase over Year 2 low-end.*

### Conservative Bottom Line

Using **only the low-end numbers** and the lowest sale multiple (1.5x):

| Scenario | Year 1 Sale Value | Year 2 Sale Value | Year 3 Sale Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| **No website (today)** | $45,000-$80,000 | Same | Same |
| **Option 1 ($5,500 + $157/mo)** | $73,800 | **$99,150** | **$114,150** |
| **Option 2 ($2,750 + $99/mo)** | $74,000 | **$88,200** | **$97,200** |

Even at the most conservative end, **Option 1 adds ~$19,000 to your sale price by Year 2** and **~$34,000 by Year 3.** That's a 3-6x return on the total investment. Option 2 adds ~$8,000 by Year 2 and ~$17,000 by Year 3 at similarly conservative assumptions.

**The website investment of $2,750-$5,500 is the highest-ROI move you can make before listing the business.**

### What Transfers to a Buyer

| Asset | Transfers? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Website + domain | **Yes** | All rankings, traffic, and content transfer automatically |
| Shopify store + revenue | **Yes** | Documented monthly sales in Shopify analytics |
| Google Business Profile | **Yes** | Reviews, ranking, and map pack visibility stay |
| Blog content + SEO authority | **Yes** | 12-18 months of content builds lasting value |
| Wrestling meet relationships | **Partially** | Buyer would need to maintain these personally |
| Car show trophy orders | **Partially** | Relationship-dependent, harder to transfer |
| Walk-in foot traffic | **Yes** | Location-based, doesn't depend on owner |

---

## Immediate Priority: Google Business Profile

Regardless of which option you choose, **optimizing your Google Business Profile should start immediately.** It doesn't depend on the website and delivers the fastest results.

### Current State
- 6 reviews at 4.3 stars
- Not appearing in the Google Map Pack for any trophy-related searches

### What Needs to Happen
1. Complete all GBP fields (hours, services, attributes, description)
2. Add 20+ high-quality photos of your shop and products
3. Begin review generation — goal: 40+ reviews at 4.5+ stars within 6 months
4. Post weekly updates (new products, seasonal promotions, community involvement)
5. Ensure NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across all online directories

### Expected Impact
GBP optimization alone can drive 70-160 visits/month by Month 12 — nearly half of all projected local traffic. **Every wrestling meet and car show is a chance to ask a happy customer for a Google review.**

---

## Why Not Paid Advertising?

Our research confirmed that Google Ads are **cost-prohibitive** for this industry:

| Channel | Cost Per Customer Acquired | Typical Order Value | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Ads (medals) | ~$300 per sale | $50-$75 | **Lose $225-$250 per sale** |
| Google Ads (plaques) | ~$225 per sale | $40-$80 | **Lose $145-$185 per sale** |
| **SEO (this proposal)** | **$0.50-$5 per lead** | $65-$200 | **100-600x more efficient** |

---

## Timeline

### Option 1 (8-12 Weeks)

| Week | Milestone |
|---|---|
| Week 1-2 | GBP optimization, design mockups, Shopify store setup |
| Week 3-4 | Lead-gen site: homepage, service pages, area pages |
| Week 5-6 | Shopify: product catalog, collections, Zakeke configuration |
| Week 7-8 | Shopify: product photography, descriptions, pricing |
| Week 9-10 | Cross-site linking, analytics, testing |
| Week 11-12 | Launch, submit sitemaps, begin marketing |

**Target launch: April 2026** — captures the spring sports awards peak and gives you 12-18 months of documented growth before listing the business.

### Option 2 (4-6 Weeks)

| Week | Milestone |
|---|---|
| Week 1 | GBP optimization, design mockups, content planning |
| Week 2-3 | Homepage, service pages, schema markup |
| Week 4 | Area-served pages, blog posts, contact/quote forms |
| Week 5 | Testing, mobile optimization, analytics setup |
| Week 6 | Launch, submit sitemap, begin review generation campaign |

**Target launch: March 2026** — captures the spring peak even earlier.

---

## What's Included

### Both Options
- Custom-designed, mobile-responsive website
- On-page SEO optimization (meta tags, schema markup, internal linking)

- Google Business Profile optimization
- XML sitemap and robots.txt configuration
- 301 redirects from existing Wix site
- Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1)
- Quote request form with email notifications
- 3-5 launch blog posts

### Option 1 Additional
- Shopify store setup and configuration
- 50-100 product listings with optimized descriptions
- Zakeke product customizer integration and template setup
- Collection pages with SEO-optimized content
- Guest checkout configuration
- Shipping calculator setup
- Cross-domain analytics tracking

---

## Recommendation

**Option 1 ($5,500 + $157/mo) is the strongest move for selling the business.** The online store creates documented, transferable revenue that a buyer can verify in Shopify analytics. It doesn't depend on you being there. For $2,750 more upfront and $58/mo more than Option 2, you add a nationwide e-commerce channel that conservatively adds ~$19,000 to your sale price by Year 2 — and keeps growing.

Option 2 ($2,750 + $99/mo) is a solid, lower-cost alternative if you want to minimize spending. It still builds local SEO value and Google reviews that transfer to a buyer. And the architecture supports adding a Shopify store later — either before you sell or as a selling point ("the site is built to easily add e-commerce").

Both options include monthly SEO management: new blog content, keyword tracking, competitor monitoring, technical updates, and Google Business Profile maintenance — the ongoing work that keeps rankings growing.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Option 1 or Option 2**
2. **Begin Google Business Profile optimization** (can start this week, independent of website build)
3. **Schedule a kickoff meeting** to discuss product photography, content needs, and launch timeline
4. **Target launch:** March-April 2026 to capture the spring sports awards peak and build 12-18 months of documented traffic before listing
