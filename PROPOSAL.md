# The Trophy Case — Website & Digital Strategy Proposal

**Prepared for:** Gregg Schmidt, Owner
**Business:** The Trophy Case, 303 N Main St, Fremont, NE 68025
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The Trophy Case has been serving Fremont and the surrounding community for years, but its current online presence is virtually invisible. Your Wix website generates less than 1 visit per month, ranks for zero keywords in the top 10, and lists no products — only links to external supplier catalogs. Meanwhile, competitors with basic websites are capturing customers who search online for trophies, plaques, and engraving services in the Omaha metro area.

The good news: **Fremont has zero trophy shop competitors online.** You own your local market by default — the website just needs to be findable. And the broader Omaha metro market (950,000+ population) is served by only 6-8 shops, none of which dominate digitally. The top local competitor ranks for just 93 keywords with 454 monthly visits — a very low bar to clear.

This proposal presents two options to establish The Trophy Case's digital presence and drive measurable revenue growth.

## The Problem

### Current Website Performance

| Metric | Current (Wix Site) | Local Leader (Center Trophy) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly organic traffic | **0.8 visits** | 454 visits |
| Organic keywords ranked | 5 | 93 |
| Keywords in top 10 | **0** | 7 |
| Google reviews | 6 (4.3 stars) | 47 (4.9 stars) |
| Products listed on site | **0** | Full catalog |

### What's Costing You Customers

1. **No products on the website.** Visitors see supplier flipbook links instead of your actual inventory and pricing.
2. **Not appearing in Google searches.** Zero top-10 rankings means zero organic traffic from search.
3. **Weak Google Business Profile.** 6 reviews at 4.3 stars vs. competitors with 30-55 reviews at 4.5+ stars keeps you out of the Google Map Pack.
4. **No quote request system.** No way for customers to request pricing online.
5. **No mobile optimization.** Over 60% of local searches happen on mobile devices.

## Market Opportunity

### Local Market (Fremont + Omaha Metro)

- **Fremont/Dodge County (35,000 population):** Zero trophy shop competitors. Estimated $60,000-$150,000/year capturable market.
- **Omaha Metro (950,000 population):** 6-8 competitors, none digitally dominant. Estimated $60,000-$320,000/year capturable share.
- **Combined opportunity:** $120,000-$400,000/year depending on strategy aggressiveness.

### Search Demand

| Keyword Category | Monthly Searches | Competition Level |
|---|---|---|
| "trophy shop" + city terms (Omaha/Fremont) | ~200/mo | Low (KD 3-5) |
| "near me" trophy/engraving searches | ~70/mo local | Low-Medium (KD 4-33) |
| "custom medals" (national) | 4,400/mo | Medium (KD 18) |
| "custom plaques" (national) | 6,600/mo | Medium (KD 23) |

### Seasonality

Trophy/award searches peak in **April-May** (spring sports, Q1 corporate recognition) and **July-August** (summer leagues, back-to-school). A February-March launch captures the first peak.

## Option 1: Local Lead-Generation Website

### What You Get

A professionally built, SEO-optimized website focused on generating local leads — phone calls, quote requests, and walk-in traffic from customers searching online.

**22-28 pages at launch:**
- Homepage with trust signals, services overview, and calls to action
- 7 service pages (custom trophies, medals, plaques, engraving, acrylic awards, glass awards, corporate awards)
- 5 area-served pages (Fremont, Omaha, Wahoo, Blair, Dodge County)
- Gallery/portfolio, About, Contact, FAQ, Reviews page
- Blog (launch with 3-5 posts, add 2/month ongoing)

### Technology

| Component | Solution | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js (static site generation) | Free |
| Hosting | Vercel | Free |
| Forms | Formspree (50 submissions/mo) | Free |
| Analytics | Google Analytics 4 + Search Console | Free |
| Domain | thetrophycasefremont.com (existing) | ~$15/yr |
| **Total platform cost** | | **$15/year** |

### Traffic Projections

| Timeline | Monthly Visits | Qualified Leads/Month |
|---|---|---|
| Month 6 | 55-100 | 3-8 |
| Month 12 | 150-250 | 8-20 |
| Month 18 | 220-350 | 11-28 |
| Month 24 | 270-440 | 14-35 |

| Period | Revenue from Website | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $2,500-$8,000 | Slow ramp; most revenue in Q3-Q4 |
| Year 2 | $12,000-$40,000 | SEO maturity + repeat customers |

### Investment & ROI

| Metric | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Build cost | $3,000-$5,000 |
| Annual maintenance | $500-$1,000 |
| Breakeven | Month 12-18 |
| 2-Year ROI | 200-900% |

## Option 2: Lead-Gen + E-Commerce (Recommended)

### What You Get

Everything in Option 1, **plus** a Shopify-powered online store with visual product customization that lets customers design and order medals, plaques, and awards online — shipped nationwide.

**80-120 pages at launch:**
- Full lead-gen site (same as Option 1)
- Shopify store with 50-100 products across medal, plaque, and trophy collections
- Zakeke visual product customizer — customers preview their engraving, logos, and colors in real-time before ordering
- Guest checkout, shipping calculator, discount codes, inventory management

### Why E-Commerce Matters

Your two most successful competitors both run on Shopify:
- **Trophy Depot:** 19,578 visits/mo, ~$83K traffic value — Shopify store
- **K2 Awards:** 88,644 visits/mo — Shopify store

Neither offers real-time visual product customization. **Zakeke gives The Trophy Case a competitive edge that no mid-tier competitor has.** Customers can see exactly what their engraved plaque or custom medal will look like before ordering — instead of ordering blind like they do on Trophy Depot.

### Technology

| Component | Solution | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lead-gen site (Next.js + Vercel) | Same as Option 1 | $0 | $0 |
| E-commerce platform | Shopify Basic | $39 | $468 |
| Product customizer | Zakeke Starter (50 products) | $19 | $228 |
| Domain | thetrophycasefremont.com | — | $15 |
| **Total platform cost** | | **$58/mo** | **$711/yr** |

| Annual platform costs | ~$711 |
| Breakeven | Month 10-15 |
| 2-Year ROI | 400-1,500% |

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Metric | Option 1 | Option 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Build investment** | $3,000-$5,000 | $8,000-$12,000 |
| **Annual platform costs** | $15 | $711 |
| **Year 1 revenue** | $2,500-$8,000 | $8,000-$28,000 |
| **Year 2 revenue** | $12,000-$40,000 | $50,000-$180,000 |
| **24-month cumulative revenue** | $14,500-$48,000 | $58,000-$208,000 |
| **24-month net profit** | $8,500-$42,000 | $45,600-$191,600 |
| **Breakeven** | Month 12-18 | Month 10-15 |
| **Market reach** | Fremont + Omaha metro | Local + nationwide |
| **Build timeline** | 4-6 weeks | 8-12 weeks |

**Option 2 costs ~2.5x more upfront but generates ~4x the revenue over 24 months.** The additional investment pays for itself within the first year and compounds dramatically in Year 2.

## Immediate Priority: Google Business Profile

Regardless of which option you choose, **optimizing your Google Business Profile should start immediately.** It doesn't depend on the website and delivers the fastest results.

### Current State
- 6 reviews at 4.3 stars
- Not appearing in the Google Map Pack for any trophy-related searches

### What Needs to Happen
1. Complete all GBP fields (hours, services, attributes, description)
2. Add 20+ high-quality photos of your shop and products
3. Begin review generation — goal: 40+ reviews at 4.5+ stars within 6 months
4. Post weekly updates (new products, seasonal promotions, community involvement)
5. Ensure NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across all online directories

### Expected Impact
GBP optimization alone can drive 70-160 visits/month by Month 12 — nearly half of all projected local traffic.

## Why Not Paid Advertising?

Our research confirmed that Google Ads are **cost-prohibitive** for this industry:

| Channel | Cost Per Customer Acquired | Typical Order Value | Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Ads (medals) | ~$300 per sale | $50-$75 | **Lose $225-$250 per sale** |
| Google Ads (plaques) | ~$225 per sale | $40-$80 | **Lose $145-$185 per sale** |
| **SEO (this proposal)** | **$0.50-$5 per lead** | $65-$200 | **100-600x more efficient** |

Organic SEO delivers customer acquisition costs that are **100-600x more efficient** than paid advertising. The website is the investment; the traffic is free after that.

## Timeline

### Option 1 (4-6 Weeks)

| Week | Milestone |
|---|---|
| Week 1 | GBP optimization, design mockups, content planning |
| Week 2-3 | Homepage, service pages, schema markup |
| Week 4 | Area-served pages, blog posts, contact/quote forms |
| Week 5 | Testing, mobile optimization, analytics setup |
| Week 6 | Launch, submit sitemap, begin review generation campaign |

### Option 2 (8-12 Weeks)

| Week | Milestone |
|---|---|
| Week 1-2 | GBP optimization, design mockups, Shopify store setup |
| Week 3-4 | Lead-gen site: homepage, service pages, area pages |
| Week 5-6 | Shopify: product catalog, collections, Zakeke configuration |
| Week 7-8 | Shopify: product photography, descriptions, pricing |
| Week 9-10 | Cross-site linking, analytics, testing |
| Week 11-12 | Launch, submit sitemaps, begin marketing |

---

## What's Included

### Both Options
- Custom-designed, mobile-responsive website
- On-page SEO optimization (meta tags, schema markup, internal linking)
- Google Analytics 4 + Search Console setup
- Google Business Profile optimization
- XML sitemap and robots.txt configuration
- 301 redirects from existing Wix site
- Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1)
- Quote request form with email notifications
- 3-5 launch blog posts

### Option 2 Additional
- Shopify store setup and configuration
- 50-100 product listings with optimized descriptions
- Zakeke product customizer integration and template setup
- Collection pages with SEO-optimized content
- Guest checkout configuration
- Shipping calculator setup
- Cross-domain analytics tracking

---

## Recommendation

**We recommend Option 2.** The additional $5,000-$7,000 in build cost generates $43,500-$160,000 more revenue over 24 months. The Shopify e-commerce store with Zakeke visual customization gives The Trophy Case a genuine competitive advantage that no mid-tier competitor in this space currently offers — and the platform costs of $58/month are trivial relative to projected returns.

However, Option 1 is a solid, low-risk starting point if you prefer to prove the concept with local lead generation first and add e-commerce later. The Next.js architecture supports adding Shopify integration in the future without rebuilding.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Option 1 or Option 2**
2. **Begin Google Business Profile optimization** (can start this week, independent of website build)
3. **Schedule a kickoff meeting** to discuss product photography, content needs, and launch timeline
4. **Target launch:** Before April to capture the spring sports awards peak season
